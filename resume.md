===================

---------------------------------------------------
Depuis plus de 20 ans dans le domaine de l'informatique, j'ai eu l'opportunité d'avoir plusieurs expériences professionnelles très enrichissantes.
Du helpdesk très formateur à mes débuts au poste d'ingénieur systèmes en passant par une première expérience managériale significative finalement trop éloigné de la technique.
Aujourd'hui je suis ravi d'apporter mes compétences et mon énergie au service du leader européen du cloud : OVHcloud. 
Une très belle aventure en perspective dans laquelle j'ai la chance de pourvoir concilier technique et management avec mon nouveau rôle d'IT Team Leader !
Sans oublier mon rôle de mentor Openclassroom qui me permets d'apporter mon expérience dans l'accompagnement d'étudiants, souvent en reconversion professionnelle.

For more than 20 years in the IT field, I have had the opportunity to have several very enriching professional experiences.
From the very formative helpdesk to my first position as a systems engineer, and a first significant managerial experience that was finally too far from the technical side.
Today I am delighted to bring my skills and energy to the service of the European leader in the cloud: OVHcloud. 
A great adventure ahead in which I have the chance to combine technical and management skills with my new role as IT Team Leader !
Not forgetting my role as an Openclassroom mentor, which allows me to contribute my experience in supporting students, who are often in the process of changing careers.

Experience
----------

**Your Most Recent Work Experience:**

Short text containing the type of work done, results obtained,
lessons learned and other remarks. Can also include lists and
links:

* First item

* Item with [link](http://www.example.com). Links will work both in
  the html and pdf versions.

**That Other Job You Had**

Also with a short description.

Technical Experience
--------------------

My Cool Side Project
:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
    list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages
:   **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**

Extra Section, Call it Whatever You Want
----------------------------------------

* Human Languages:

     * English (native speaker)
     * ???
     * This is what a nested list looks like.

* Random tidbit

* Other sort of impressive-sounding thing you did
